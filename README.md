# Personal Knowledge Base Assistant using RAG

This repository contains the implementation of a **Personal Knowledge Base Assistant** powered by **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using Hugging Face Transformers. The assistant is designed to provide contextually accurate and personalized responses by leveraging your own knowledge base. 

---

## Features
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines retrieval from a custom knowledge base with a language model for accurate and contextually relevant answers.
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** Leverages state-of-the-art transformer models for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Custom Knowledge Base Support:** Easy integration with your personal or organizational documents.
- **Extensible Design:** Modular implementation for scaling and adding new functionalities.
