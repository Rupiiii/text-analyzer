# Personal Knowledge Base Assistant using RAG

This repository contains the implementation of a **Personal Knowledge Base Assistant** powered by **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using Hugging Face Transformers. The assistant is designed to provide contextually accurate and personalized responses by leveraging your own knowledge base. 

---

## Features
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines retrieval from a custom knowledge base with a language model for accurate and contextually relevant answers.
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** Leverages state-of-the-art transformer models for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Custom Knowledge Base Support:** Easy integration with your personal or organizational documents.
- **Extensible Design:** Modular implementation for scaling and adding new functionalities.

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Knowledge Base:**
   - Place your knowledge base files in the `data/knowledge_base/` directory.
   - Run preprocessing:
     ```bash
     python src/preprocessing.py
     ```

2. **Start the Assistant:**
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

3. **Interact with the Assistant:**
   - Provide queries through the CLI or integrate the assistant into a web app.
